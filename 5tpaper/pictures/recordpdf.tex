  \caption{The record illustrating maximal solution of the relaxed problem. This solution is obtained for the octagon $(10, 8, 10, 12, 10, 8, 10, 12)$. Since this is a relaxed problem (\ref{lp0})---(\ref{lp4}), the grayness in the Figure indicates the value of the move, that is a number between $0$ and $1$.  }
