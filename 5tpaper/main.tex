\title{\therecord - a new upper bound for Morpion Solitaire}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
%We express properties of a Morpion~5T position graph by a linear program.
In \cite{demaine} an upper bound of 705  was proved on the number of moves in the 5T variant of the Morpion Solitaire game. We show a new upper bound of \therecord moves. This is achieved in the following way: we encode Morpion 5T rules as a linear program and solve \theoctagons instances of this program on 
%restrict the infinite grid on which the Morpion~5T game is played to one of 
 special octagonal boards. % and solve linear programs encoding Morpion 5T positions on these boards.
In order to show correctness of this method we analyze rules of the game and use a concept of a potential of a given position. By solving continuous-valued relaxations of linear programs on these boards, we obtain an upper bound of $586$ moves.
Further analysis of original, not relaxed, mixed-integer programs leads to an improvement of this bound to \therecord moves. However, this is achieved at a significantly higher computational cost.
