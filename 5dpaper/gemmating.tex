\subsection{Symmetries}
The $8$-element group of isometries of the plane generated by 
\begin{itemize}
\item reflections with respect to the axes and 
\item rotations around the center of the $\Cross$ through the straight angle,
\end{itemize}
 %There is an $8$-element group of isometries of the $\mathbb{Z}^2$ grid that 
leave the $\Cross$ in place. 
Up to these $8$ symmetries every Morpion 5D position is contained in a bounding box $(a,b,c,d)$ such that
  $a \leq b,c,d$ and $b \leq d$. 

\subsection{Resizing of boxes}
Starting from the smallest box containing the $\Cross$, we generate a list of of all boxes relevant for 
Morpion 5D gameplays. That is, iteratively we check using a linear solver whether the box can be extended. 
The iterative step is summarized in the following code.
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Python,
  basicstyle=\ttfamily\scriptsize,keywordstyle=\color{red},backgroundcolor=\color{white}]
while unsolved:
    box = unsolved.pop()
    # we use a linear solver to establish if a given box can extended
    result = solve(box)         
    solved.append(box)

    if result.bound > bound:
        bound = result.bound
        
    if result.type == "FEASIBLE":
        [ a, b, c, d ] = box

        # we add four potential new boxes to the list of boxes which should be analyzed
        gemmate = [ [ a+1, b, c, d], [a, b+1, c, d], [a, b, c+1, d], [a, b, c, d+1],
                    [ a+1,b+1, c,d], [a, b+1,c+1,d], [a,b, c+1,d+1], [a+1,b,c, d+1] ]
        
        # ... and eliminate these casses which were 
        #          - already solved or 
        #          - are already present on the stack.
        # this process is done up to symmetry 
        # the symmetry code is the Appendix             
        for g in gemmate:
            if symmetryClass(g) not in solved + unsolved:
                unsolved.append(symmetryClass(g))
\end{lstlisting}
