\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
The Morpion Solitaire is a paper-and-pencil single-player game played on a square grid with initial position consisting of $36$ dots.
In each move the player puts a dot on an unused grid position and draws a line that 
  consists of four consecutive segments passing through the dot.
 The goal is to find the longest possible sequence of moves.
There are two main variants of the game: 5T and 5D. 
They have different restrictions on how the moves may intersect.

Providing lower and upper bounds in Morpion Solitaire is a significant computational and mathematical challenge
  that led to a discovery of an important new algorithm.
 Best lower bounds for Morpion Solitaire were found in $2011$ by Rosin \cite{rosin} using a variant of the Monte Carlo method: 
 $178$ moves for the 5T variant, $82$ moves for the 5D variant.
 
% In the Morpion 5T variant an upper bound of $705$ was proved in $2006$ by Demaine at al. \cite{demaine}  using a method of potential. 
% A refinement of this approach was used in $2015$  in \cite{ijcai} to show a bound of $485$ - this method combined an isoperimetric inequality with linear programming. 

In the Morpion 5D variant 
Kawamura et al. proved in \cite{japonczycy} an upper bound of $121$ moves using a geometrical argument. 
We improve this bound to $84$. 
This is done in two steps.
1) We state, using linear constraints, a geometric property that defines a class of graphs that includes all Morpion  positions --- finding practically solvable linear constraints is a main conceptual advance of the present paper.
2) We solve the mixed integer problems and obtain 
an upper bound of \therecord for Morpion 5D. The same method fully solves Morpion 5D with center symmetry --- the optimal sequence is $68$ moves long. % and b) gives an upper bound of $222$ for Morpion 5T with center symmetry.
