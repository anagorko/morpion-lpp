\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
The Morpion Solitaire is a paper-and-pencil single-player game played on a square grid with initial position consisting of $36$ dots.
In each move the player puts a dot on an unused grid position and draws a line that 
  consists of four consecutive segments passing through the dot.
 The goal is to find the longest possible sequence of moves.
There are two main variants of the game: 5T and 5D. 
They have different restrictions on how the moves may intersect.

Providing lower and upper bounds in Morpion Solitaire is a significant computational and mathematical challenge
  that led to important algorithmical discoveries.
 Best lower bounds for Morpion Solitaire were obtained using a variant of the Monte Carlo method: 
 $178$ moves for the 5T variant, $82$ moves for the 5D variant.
 Both bounds were found in $2011$ by Rosin. 
 
 In the Morpion 5T variant an upper bound of $705$ was proved in $2006$ by Demaine at al. using a method of potential. 
A refinement of this approach was used in $2015$  by Michalewski et al. to show a bound of $485$ - this method combined an isoperimetric inequality with linear programming. 

In the Morpion 5D variant 
Kawamura et al. proved an upper bound of $121$ moves using a mathematical argument. 
We improve this bound to \therecord. 
This is done in two steps.
1) We state, using linear constraints, a geometric property that defines a class of graphs that includes all Morpion  positions - finding practically solvable linear constraints is a main conceptual advance of the present paper.
2) We solve the mixed integer problems and obtain 
an upper bound of \therecord for Morpion 5D. The same method a) fully solves Morpion 5D with center symmetry (the optimal sequence is $68$ moves long) and b) gives an upper bound of $222$ for Morpion 5T with center symmetry.

\section{Introduction}
The Morpion Solitaire is a paper-and-pencil single-player game played on a square grid with 
  the initial configuration of 36 dots depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:initial}. 
In each move the player puts a dot on an unused grid position and draws a line that 
  consists of four consecutive segments passing through the dot. 
The line must be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 
The goal is to find the longest possible sequence of moves.
There are two main variants of the game: 5T and 5D. 
They have different restrictions on how the moves may be placed.
In the 5T variant of the game, no segment may be drawn twice, i.e. the moves have to be segment-disjoint. 
In the 5D variant of the game, any two moves in the same direction have to be dot-disjoint.
The difference is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rules}.
The 5D variant is more restrictive. In Morpion 5D there has to be a gap between moves
  placed on a same line.

The problem is notoriously hard for computers. 
For $34$ years the longest known sequence in the Morpion 5T game
  was one of 170 moves discovered by C.-H. Bruneau in $1976$. 
Despite considerable computational effort, until $2010$ the computer generated
  sequences were much shorter.
In $2010$, a Nested Rollout Policy Adapation algorithm (a Monte Carlo variant) 
  was developed by Christopher D. Rosin~\cite{rosin} (best paper award at IJCAI11).
Using NRPA, Rosin obtained the current world record of $178$ moves in Morpion 5T 
  and of $82$ moves in Morpion 5D.
The webpage~\cite{} maintained by Christian Boyer, contains an extensive and up-to-date information about records in all Morpion Solitaire variants.

As the rules of Morpion Solitaire do not limit the size of the grid on which the game is played, a priori
  it is not clear if the sequences have to be bounded.
A popular magazine \emph{Science \& Vie} published in $1970$'s different bounds submitted by its readers 
  for the maximal length of a sequence in Morpion 5T
  (the bounds ranged $540$ to $20736$), but without detailed and/or valid proofs.
The first rigorously proved bound of $705$ in Morpion 5T was published by Demaine et al in $2006$~\cite{}.
The best known bound of $485$ in Morpion 5T was proved in~\cite{}.
In this paper we prove an upper bound of $84$ on the length of Morpion 5D sequence, improving upon earlier bound of $121$ by A.~Kawamura~\cite{}.

Proofs of upper bound discussed above exploit geometry of the graphs that are obtained as Morpion Solitaire positions. We'll discuss in detail the bound of $705$ proved in~\cite{brass}.

(TODO: Brass = isoperimetric inequality, relationship between number of vertices and edges in 5T graphs)

In~\cite{} we used isoperimetric inequality combined with mixed integer programming to obtain an upper bound of $485$ for Morpion 5T. 
The method employed in~\cite{} does not give useful upper bound for the 5D variant.
In the present paper we use a new technique of gemmating to limit the size of a bounding box of a Morpion 5D graph combined with a new reduction of Morpion Solitaire to a mixed integer programming to obtain a bound of $84$ for Morpion 5D. 
  
\section{Geometry of Morpion position graphs}
Consider a Morpion 5D position shown on the left in Figure~\ref{fig:small}. 
The diagram shows a position of a Morpion 5D playout.
We observe that such a diagram allows us to decode the move sequence,
  even though in the example given there are three diffrent lines passing through dot with number $1$
  and it might be not clear which line corresponds to the first move.
However, the last move (in the given ordering) is unique. 
The rest of the moves can be decoded recursively, descending from the last moves in the sequence.
Observe that some of the moves in the sequence may be interchangeable.
However, the set of the played moves is unique with respect to the positions of the moves.

\begin{definition}
  Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. 
  Let $C \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ be a set of $36$ dots that form an initial cross of Morpion Solitaire.
  We shall use the following notions.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A \emph{unit segment} is a segment with endpoints in the square grid $\mathbb{Z}^2$ and length 
    	equal to $1$ in the $\ell_\infty$ metric.
    \item A graph $G$ is a \emph{lattice graph} if $V \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$
      and each edge of $G$ is a unit segment.
    \item Let 
    \[
      \mathcal{M} = \{ \{ (s_1, s_2), (s_2, s_3), (s_3, s_4), (s_4, s_5) \} \colon s_i \in \mathbb{Z}^2, s_{i+1} - s_i = s_i - s_{i-1} \}
    \]
    Elements of $\mathcal{M}$ are called \emph{moves}. 
    Every move consists of four consecutive, distinct, parallel unit segments that intersect at endpoints.
    We let
    \[
      \mathcal{M}(G) = \{ m \in \mathcal{M} \colon m \subset E \}
    \]
    It is the set of all moves that cover edges of $G$. We call $\mathcal{M}(G)$ the set of \emph{moves in $G$}.
    \item A \emph{marked move} is a move $m$ with a selected vertex $d(m)$ that is one of the endpoints
      of its segments, i.e
      \[
      	d(m) \in (s_i, s_{i+1}) \in m.
      \]
    \item We say that a set $\mathcal{M}(G)$ of moves in $G$ with a marking $d \colon \mathcal{M}(G) \to V$ is \emph{5D-disjoint} if
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $m_1, m_2 \in \mathcal{M}(G)$ are parallel, then $m_1$, $m_2$ are vertex disjoint.
        \item The set of unmarked vertices $V \setminus d(\mathcal{M}(G))$ forms the initial cross $C$ of Morpion Solitaire.
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

    \caption{\label{fig:small}
      A Morpion 5D position (left) and a corresponding unordered Morpion 5D graph (right)
    }
  \end{figure}
 
\begin{definition}
  A lattice graph $G$ is an \emph{unordered Morpion 5D graph} if the set $\mathcal{M}(G)$ of moves of $G$ allows a marking such that it is 5D-disjoint.
\end{definition}

See Figure~\ref{fig:small} (right) to see a diagram of an unordered 5D graph.
There is an unordered Morpion 5D graph correcponding to every Morpion 5D position, obtained 
  by forgetting the order of the moves.
There are Morpion 5D graphs that do not correspond to Morpion 5D positions.
Figure~\ref{fig:85} shows such an example.
  
    \begin{figure}[h]\label{fig:85}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/85.pdf}
    \caption{
      An unordered Morpion 5D graph of size $85$
    }
  \end{figure}

A bounding box of a Morpion 5D graph is a smallest rectangular grid that contains it.
Every Morpion 5D graph contains the starting cross and the smallest bounding box has dimensions $9 \times 9$. 
A bounding box may be described by distances of its edges from the edges of the cross.
For graph depicted on Figure~\ref{fig:85} the distance from top edge of the cross to the top side of the bounding box is equal to $3$. For right side it is $4$, bottom $1$ and left $1$. We write that the bounding box of graph from Figure~\ref{fig:85} has bounding box $(3,4,1,1)$.
  
  There is an $8$-element group of isometries of the $\mathbb{Z}^2$ grid that leave the starting cross in place.
  Up to these symmetries every Morpion 5D graph is contained in a bounding box $(a,b,c,d)$ such that
  $a \leq b,c,d$ and $b \leq d$.

  In the sequel we show that every Morpion 5D graph that corresponds to a Morpion 5D position
    must be contained (up to symmetry) in one of the bounding boxes listed in table~\ref{tbl:boundingboxes}.
  
\input{table.tex} 
  
  The largest bounding box (in terms of area) has dimensions $ \times $ and contains $..$ dots.

  For each bounding box listed in table~\ref{tbl:} we solve a mixed integer programming problem to
    find the maximal size of a Morpion 5D graph with such a bounding box.
    
  In four cases we obtain the size of $85$.
  
  In the sequel we define and solve mixed integer programming problems to compute the maximum 
    number of moves 
    


  Observe that every Morpion 5D position gives a graph with the above properties.
