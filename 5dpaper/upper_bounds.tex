\subsection{An upper bound of \therecord for Morpion 5D}

In order to improve the result from $85$ to $8$ we have to consider three cases of bounding boxes which allow marked Morpion 5D graphs of size $85$. These
are specifically boxes $(4,3,1,1)$, $(4,3,1,2)$, $(4,3,1,3)$ \todo{At the first glance the last is the largest. What is going on?} 
On these three boards we solve a more difficult problem with the cutoff condition set to $84.9$ --- not only we require that a given solution is a 
Morpion 5D graph, but additionally we also require that the graph is {\em acyclic}. \todo{Explain what is acyclity}
