\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Computations}
The total time to solve all involved linear problems appearing in Table \ref{tbl:boundingboxes} amounted to approximately 3000 hours on a single core of a 
Linux machine equipped with {\tt Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered}} {\tt Xeon\textsuperscript{\textregistered}} {\tt CPU 5620@2.40GHz} with 24GB of RAM. 
We used \cite{gurobi} linear optimization software. The code generating the linear programs is available in the repository \cite{thewebpage}. 

\subsection{Further research}
The results presented in this paper are based on a specific generalization of Morpion 5D game. Using this generalization the 
task of reducing the bound from $84$ down to $82$ seems to be feasible, but requires significant computational effort. It would be interesting
to see another generalization which is less costly in terms of required computations, that is avoids the condition \L{7} in favor of another, easier to compute 
requirement. 

The same method can be used to show an upper bound in the symmetric Morpion 5T. The method used in \cite{ijcai} leads to the bound of $485$ in arbitrary Morpion 5T game. 
A record of 136 moves in symmetric Morpion 5T was found by M.~Quist and is presented in \cite{boyer}. We conjecture that an upper bound of approximately 200 moves can be found
using methods presented in this paper.
